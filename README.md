Project Title: Power BI Dashboard with Advanced Charts and Filters

Description:

This repository contains a Power BI project that showcases a variety of essential charts and data visualizations using a simple dataset. The file includes the following features:

Column Chart: Visualizing data comparisons and trends across categories.
Pie Chart & Donut Chart: Displaying proportional data distribution.
Funnel Chart: Illustrating stages of a process with progressive narrowing.
Ribbon Chart: Presenting flows of data between different categories.
Dynamic Filters (Include/Exclude): Customizable filters to allow users to drill down and focus on relevant data.
Iâ€™ve used a basic dataset with subjects and their corresponding performance data (marks, completion times, difficulty levels, etc.) to create these visuals. You can explore these charts and customize them further based on your needs.

Feel free to explore the project, and contribute to its improvement if you find it useful. Looking forward to any suggestions or feedback!
